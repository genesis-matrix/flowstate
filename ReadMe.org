#+TITLE: Introduction to FlowState (for Saltstack)
#+SUBTITLE: FlowState is a tool for visualising the runtime dependency graph of a Salt highstate.


** Purpose

FlowState is a tool for visualising the runtime dependency graph of a [[https://github.com/saltstack/salt][Salt]] highstate.

It takes the json output of =state.show_highstate= or =state.show_sls=
from Salt and produces a program written in [[http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html][dot]], which is a tool from
Graphviz for defining an acyclic graph.

States are nodes and dependencies are edges. =require= and =require_in= are blue; =watch= and =watch_in= are red.

Some examples, with the dot programs rendered as png:

** Usage

The tool expects the JSON output of =show_highstate= or =show_sls= over stdin.
It outputs =dot= code representing the dependency graph. The dot code defines a
single digraph called "states".

For example, if you have a salt master running:

#+begin_src bash
  salt 'minion1' state.show_highstate --out json | flowstate
#+end_src

You can write the dot output to a file, or pipe it further into the `dot` tool
from GraphViz. In this example, we produce a png called `output.png`:

#+begin_src bash
  salt 'minion*' state.show_highstate --out json \
	| flowstate \
	| dot -Tpng -o output.png
#+end_src

The tool currently only supports rendering the output from one minion. If you
give it output with two minions, it'll report an error.

** Installation

Install directly from PyPi:

#+begin_src bash
  pip install flowstate
#+end_src

Or clone this repository and use =setup.py=:

#+begin_src bash
  python setup.py install
#+end_src

Unfortunately, the version of the =pydot= package in PyPi doesn't work in
Python 2.7+. We're working on getting this up to date. In the meantime, please
use this fork to install the `pydot` package first:

*** dot

Most operating systems have a package for it, usually as part of GraphViz.

- *Debian / Ubuntu*
  #+begin_src bash
    apt-get install graphviz
  #+end_src

- *OSX with homebrew*
  #+begin_src bash
	brew install graphviz
  #+end_src
